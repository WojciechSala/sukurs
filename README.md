# What's Sukurs?

Sukurs is a **currently abandoned** SPA online clothing shop. If you're interested on the design, it was made in figma and you can view the [mobile](https://www.figma.com/file/NOOPvrYMRzEpKGapwevW5E/Mobile) or [desktop](https://www.figma.com/file/babVpvH4WNWH0nwNaa72gs/Desktop) version.

###### The project is an idea of few people and is currently frozen, maybe revived in the future. No contribution expectations from outside.

## Installation

###### At that point the project is not hosted anywhere but you can run it locally.

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/WojciechSala/sukurs.git`
2. Install all libraries in package.json directories (both client and server) `npm install`
3. Run the client and backend server by `npm start`
   NOTE:
   - You will need MongoDB.
   - You will need nodemon installed to run backend or just `node start.js`

4. Make sure the mongo and mongod is running.

###### Expect unfinished code bugs and lots of commented code.
